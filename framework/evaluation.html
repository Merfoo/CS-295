                <h2>Design</h2>

                <h3>Page layout and spacing</h3>
                <p>
                    The layout of the website is very well thought out, the only recommendation I would make
                    is to perhaps make the posts column a little more narrow.
                </p>

                <h3>Functionality of navigation, forms, and widgets</h3>
                <p>
                    The navigation was nice and easy to use. It was not confusing to navigate around the site
                    and each link was clear and concise in where it would take you.
                </p>

                <h3>Color scheme</h3>
                <p>
                    I like the shade of blue and balance of colors between them on the website.
                </p>

                <h3>Logo (symbol and wordmark) design</h3>
                <p>
                    The logo looks cool but its a little difficult to know what it is.
                </p>

                <h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
                <p>
                    The website looked fine in the latest versions of Edge, Google Chrome, and Firefox.
                </p>

            <article id="content">
                <h2>Content</h2>

                <h3>Descriptive title tag</h3>
                <p>
                    It appears the currently the title tag is just the website name on posts and user pages.
                </p>

                <h3>Descriptive navigation items</h3>
                <p>
                    The navigation items were very descriptive of where they would take you.
                </p>

                <h3>Descriptive headlines and subheadlines</h3>
                <p>
                    The headlines and subheadlines were concise and the hierarchy made sense.
                </p>

                <h3>Grammatically correct writing</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of the content is submitted by users, but it looks like the content is grammatically
                    correct.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Use of keyword phrases that promote the site</h3>
                <p>
                    The only keyword phrases I could find was in the navbar, but I think thats the slogan.
                </p>

                <h3>Policy page completeness</h3>
                <p>
                    The policy is really well written and thorough!
                </p>

                <h3>Helpful language for all interactive functions (forms)</h3>
                <p>
                    All the forms were easy and pretty straightforward to use.
                </p>

                <h3>Value of content related to the ecommerce page.</h3>
                <p>
                    The UI of the subscription page is really nice, I especially like the two column layout.
                    The value from subscribing is pretty high since the money goes towards keeping the
                    server up.
