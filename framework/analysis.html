                                    The majority of my referrals came from the link in the current students page on the course site.
                                    The next source of referrals came from the site that firebase has hosted, although nothing is on 
                                    that site since I didn't set it up so its just a blank page, I'm not sure how users are getting
                                    to the Cooking Tutorials site from the firebase one. I'm also getting a couple referrals from the
                                    GitHub repository, I suspect this is because I linked to the website from the github repository. There are also
                                    referrals from <a href="https://doghousepolitics.com/" target="_blank">Doghouse Politics</a> because its linked there.
                                    The messenger referral is probably because I've sent the link in messenger to a couple of my friends.
                                    Some recommendations I would have made is to spread the website more through friends and family online
                                    by posting on some social networks.

                                    It appears that no one came to the website through organic searches which means
                                    that all of them came from paid keywords. Its good that my campaign is working
                                    in getting users to my sites but its bad that I'm not getting any users from organic
                                    searches. Recommendations to improve this is to probably
                                    add more content to the website to make Google rank it higher and modify my descriptions
                                    tag to be more specific descriptive about the website to attract more users through
                                    organic search.

                                    more human readable after the original link was made. Recommendations would be to somehow increase
                                    the ranking of more recipes by adding more recipes to the site and to promote them more through social

                                    I'm not completely sure why there 2 campaigns, but roughly 156 clicks came from
                                    the first campaign meaning that a fair amount of people came to my website through
                                    the campaign. Recommendations would be to figure out why there are 2 campaigns running
                                    and to look into ways to increase the amount of clicks my ad gets.

                                    The most searched paid keyword was "the recipes" which is a little weird in my opinion.
                                    But apparently 20% of traffic from my paid keywords were from that phrase. The phrase itself
                                    is pretty broad so its nice to know that broad phrases are being linked to the website.
                                    Recommendations would be to perhaps make the keywords more sense as they're pretty weird,
                                    an example of this would be the "cooking cooking cooking cooking" one, although these keywords
                                    were generated from Google they're still pretty weird.

                                    giving the website more recognition. Half of the views and clicks came from smartphones
                                    followed by tablets and computers. Recommendations would be to improve the UI of the website
                                    for smartphones and tablets since thats what most of the users are viewing/clicking the 
                                    website from.

                                    donate page pretty recently and didn't really share the QR code with people so I don't
                                    think a lot of traffic came from that. Recommendations would definitely be to share the QR
                                    code more with people and to have made it more, and to add it as goal to my Ad Campaign.

                                    anywhere on the website making users less likely to share on their social medias. Recommendations
                                    would be to add social network buttons to all the recipes so that it'd be easier for users to
                                    share recipes with their friends through social networks.

                                    Most the traffic to the website came from Google CPC (Cost Per Click) which I think is from
                                    the ads that Google shows. Afer Google CPC is direct which I imagine is from sharing a link
                                    to social networks, I'm not completely sure. The rest of the sources are from the current students
                                    page on the courses website followed by Google Organic (which is weird as I thought I got none from organic)
                                    , the firebase host version (which is empty), github, <a href="https://doghousepolitics.com/" target="_blank">Doghouse Politics</a>
                                    , and from messenger when I shared the website to my friends. Recommendations would be to get more website
                                    link to the website so that more traffic will be made, sharing the link to social networks would
                                    help as well to get more traffic from shared urls.

                                    Over half the sessions are from Chrome with over half followed by Safari and Edge. During development
                                    I tested the website only on Chrome so luckily I tested the website on what most of the 
                                    sessions are on. I'm a little surprised by the amount of sessions that came from Safari
                                    as I thought that most people used Chrome. Recommendations would be to test the website
                                    on Chrome, Safari, Edge, Android Mobile, and iPhone Mobile. I'm not really concerned with 
                                    the other browsers as I feel that they're not worth the development time.

                                    Most of the users operating system were running Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux in
                                    that order. Since Android and iOS are the top 2 that means that most of the users are
                                    viewing the website on their smartphone since Android and iOS are operating systems for 
                                    smartphones. This makes sense since most people like to have the recipe near them when
                                    making them so having it up on their phone makes more since than a laptop since its small.
                                    Recommendations would be to make sure the website works on the website and looks good as well
                                    since most of the users are viewing the website on their phone.
