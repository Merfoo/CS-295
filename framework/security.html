                <h2>Risks and Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    There are multiple security issues. One security issue is only having one person
                    be responsible for being super admin, having access to domain name, hosting account,
                    and CMS account. Another security issue is giving the staff ftp access when the don't
                    need it considering they already have accounts with the same access. Another security
                    issue is that the SSL certificate could only be for the domain and not subdomains.
                    Another issue is comments don't have to be processed first would could allow people
                    to post malicious content.
